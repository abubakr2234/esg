                <p>The Principles for Responsible Investment reflects the increasing<br>
                    relevance of environmental, social and corporate governance issues to<br>
                    investment practices. South Suez will only invest with fund managers that<br>
                    have ESG policies that are in line with the key standards set by the UNPRI.

                    In signing the Principles, we as investors publicly commit to adopt and<br>
                    implement them, where consistent with our fiduciary responsibilities.<br>
                    We also evaluate the effectiveness and improve the content of the Principles<br>
                    over time. Aiming to improve our ability to meet commitments to<br>
                    beneficiaries as well as better align our investment activities with the<br>
                     broader interests of society.</p>

                <span>South Suez requires fund managers to comply at a minimum with the legal<br>
                    regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate and to<br>
                    work towards relevant international best practice standards. This includes<br>
                    the IFCâ€™s Sustainability Framework which has become a benchmark for<br>
                    environmental and social risk management amongst our fund managers.

                    We use this framework to classify our portfolio companies into different<br>
                    ESG risk categories; Category A being business activities with potential<br>
                    significant adverse environmental or social risks and/or impacts that are<br>
                    diverse, irreversible, or unprecedented. This category is closely<br>
                    monitored through their ESG reports</span>
