            <p><strong> Suez recognises the importance of sustainable investing and is committed to promoting sound ESG management practices<br>
                within its portfolio. Thoughtful and well-implemented ESG management can enhance profitability and create significant value for <br>
                investors and stakeholders.</strong>
            </p>
                <p>We have therefor developed a comprehensive policy on responsible investing that addresses identifcation, analysis and management <br>
                    of potential ESG risks and opportunities, both before investment and post-investment. Addionally, the appropriate disclosure of all <br>
                    ESG consideration is required by the underlying funds in which South Suez invests.
